QC to do on converge data
- rsquare for chrom 20
- rsquare for sequenom across genome
- PCA plot
  - color by village of origin

How to share data
- decide offline
  - ped might not support doses
  - probably beagle dose file
- *bold* talk to Jessie about labels *bold*
- Phenotypes
  - Case-Control status
  - city
  - latitude
  - longitude
  - age
  - province?
  - height
  
Who's doing what?
- VCU taking the lead on:
  - population structure
  - Common variant analysis
  - Univariant analysis

Last things
- don't merge X chrom
- FTO is on 16, do chrom 16

# Wed 16:27:40
also convert to SNPtest format to run SNPtest locally

# meeting completed

# Wed 17:30:21
make sure to change merging script.  THere's something fishy going
on. here a replacement for gprobs merger.pl
zcat $(cat filelist) |\
 awk '$0  ~ /^marker / { if (count++ == 0) print; }
      $0 !~ /^marker / {                   print; }'

Let's do a regression on weight on FTO
Look for a height snp

Sequenom analysis by end of today. - done
Rsquare analysis by end of tomorrow. 
send richard email with location of GLs. - done
Email jiejin at BGI about xlsx files for sequenom. - Jessie solved this

###########
# Fri Mar 22 14:49:15 GMT 2013
compare 500 previously done sequenom with round2 sequenoms

###########
# Tue Mar 26 12:22:47 GMT 2013
- start running a chrom at a time on pekin and fenghuang, maybe cluster3
- look at var(Pr(D|G)) as a quality measure
- search literature for snps that segregate across China

###########
# Thu Apr 04 10:12:27 BST 2013
# CONVERGE meeting
- do the r-square analysis now!
- talk to JM about variant callin
- send round a garbage collection email
- talk to xiang about which checks he does

###########
# Thu Apr 11 10:24:25 BST 2013
- do the r-square analysis now!
- burden tests
- talk to JM about variant calling
- check that current hits are not due to plate effects
- once 10x data becomes available due rsquare analyses

## what to work on?
- variant calling
- imputation
- testing for multiple phenotypes

# Fri Apr 12 16:05:17 BST 2013
# VCU tele conference

excluded samples
excluded SNPs with r-square < 0.3

VCU does
GCTA cc + neuroticism

Flint
- Mitochondria, mice filled fluoxitine

###########
# Fri Apr 12 17:13:59 BST 2013
- test snptools 
- look into indel realignment
- start working no methods

###########
# Thu Apr 25 10:23:11 BST 2013
- create whole genome allele freq plot -- xiang is clogging up sparse
- burden tests - investigate SCAT -- started reading
  - look at bayesian model
- sit together with jessie to do a gwas with lots of covariates -- jessie
  - also filter out individuals...
- look at TGP samples, map mitochondrial variance -- not started
- sign up for genetics TOC alerst -- done
- look at convergence of SNPTImpute -- done-partial

###########
# Thu May 02 10:38:34 BST 2013
# CONVERGE todo
- create whole genome allele freq plot -- xiang is clogging up sparse
- Investigate what the distribution of peakedness of gprobs is
- take a look at excluded samples
- look at TGP samples, map mitochondrial variance -- not started
- look at convergence of SNPTImpute -- done-partial
- burden tests - investigate SCAT -- started reading
  - look at bayesian model

# things to talk about with JM
- which GMMs could one use?
Gemma
fast-LMM
- convergence
- 

###########
# Thu May 09 10:09:52 BST 2013
# CONVERGE
- burden tests
- we're going to start having meetings with Shenjen
- Goncalo paper on error rates
- power analysis
- add standard deviation estimates to wgs

###########
# Fri May 10 17:34:04 BST 2013
# VCU meeting
- re-read pasaniuc paper for cost comparison

PAPER todo:

-> Value of doing imputation at all
- power to detect effect sizes
- imputation methods + marchini
- cost comparison

-> Nice Quality data

-> Biology section

Experiment

impute one high coverage sample from TGP
- call any chip's sites from 10x
- impute the rest of the sites from thousand genomes
- compare 1x and chip imputed to 10x data


###########
# Mon May 13 18:12:33 BST 2013
What to discuss with Jonathan tomorrow
- paper sections
- how to impute on high coverage samples (above)
- MCMC algorithms

###########
# Wed May 15 18:29:03 BST 2013
-pasaniuc paper
-> sequencing methods came out on top, but check sample prep cost etc.

QC to do on converge data
- rsquare for chrom 20
- rsquare for sequenom across genome
- PCA plot
  - color by village of origin

How to share data
- decide offline
  - ped might not support doses
  - probably beagle dose file
- *bold* talk to Jessie about labels *bold*
- Phenotypes
  - Case-Control status
  - city
  - latitude
  - longitude
  - age
  - province?
  - height
  
Who's doing what?
- VCU taking the lead on:
  - population structure
  - Common variant analysis
  - Univariant analysis

Last things
- don't merge X chrom
- FTO is on 16, do chrom 16

# Wed 16:27:40
also convert to SNPtest format to run SNPtest locally

# meeting completed

# Wed 17:30:21
make sure to change merging script.  THere's something fishy going
on. here a replacement for gprobs merger.pl
zcat $(cat filelist) |\
 awk '$0  ~ /^marker / { if (count++ == 0) print; }
      $0 !~ /^marker / {                   print; }'

PAPER todo:

-> Value of doing imputation at all
- power to detect effect sizes
- imputation methods + marchini
- cost comparison

-> Nice Quality data

-> Biology section

Experiment

impute one high coverage sample from TGP
- call any chip's sites from 10x
- impute the rest of the sites from thousand genomes
- compare 1x and chip imputed to 10x data


###########
# Mon May 13 18:12:33 BST 2013
What to discuss with Jonathan tomorrow
- paper sections
- how to impute on high coverage samples (above)
- MCMC algorithms

###########
# Wed May 15 18:29:03 BST 2013
-pasaniuc paper
-> sequencing methods came out on top, but check sample prep cost etc.

###########
# Mon Jun 10 15:31:08 BST 2013
New todo list:

Wimpute
- Run Beagle on test regions with TGP samples (with and without ref
panel)
- Implement AMH with correction for temp

- Implement reference panel for wimpute
-- Run aggressive imputation on chr10 and chr3 regions from Tim

# Wed Aug 21 10:35:12 BST 2013
- look at iterations reduction
- reduce burnin
- reduce RAM 
-> result: - using all floats and got rid of unnecessary matrix
             short peak usage is 483 MB with normal run usage at 353 MB
           - RAM usage will scale linearly with number of samples
           - Can drastically reduce RAM usage by using memory mapped
             files with asynchronous loading, as much of the data is
             accessed sequentially one sample at a time
           - AMH will likely increase RAM usage, but this could be
             kept low using sparse matrices

- instiAMH is c100
-> results: - change made
            - impute is now STimpute to be clearer

- full TGP with kickstart
- kickstart + adaptive
-> results: - done, nothing new

- run Beagle on 1024 sites
  - what is ram and timing?
-> results: - see timings.tsv and resMemUsage.tsv
            - insti uses an order of magnitude less peak mem
            - however, beagle could be constrained

accurate
fast
scales well in ram and time

# Thu Aug 29 10:12:40 BST 2013

- Do this right away: send na list of ok bam files that went through bqsr

  and then GATK)

  - includes GoNL parents
i) what is switch error based on GoNL parent trio phased haplotypes
ii) what is the switch error when phasing the GoNL alone


remind JM that we need to consider MAF

- use only CG2 data

using Omni 1M and 2.5M
- ask olivier

- run shapeit2 on gprobs t oget haplotypes
- window for haplotype imputation perhaps

1.2.8   Fri Jan 17 15:47:24 GMT 2014
        OpenHaps now accepts scaffolds that only contain a subset of
        the GL sites.

1.2.7   Thu Jan 16 14:20:38 GMT 2014
        Nearest neighbors are now calculated for each haplotype
        separately and then half the number of target haplotypes are
        kept from each list

1.2.6   Tue Jan 14 18:11:49 GMT 2014
        Common site haplotypes are now stored in memory

1.2.5   Tue Jan 14 17:07:50 GMT 2014
        Fixed bug where number of haps was passed to relationship.cpp instead of 
        number of sites

1.2.4   Tue Dec 10 12:29:49 GMT 2013
        Added filtering and sorting of hapsSamp samples files

1.2.3   Mon Dec 09 15:32:32 GMT 2013
        Added filtering of haps files at input to speed things up

1.2.2   Mon Dec 09 14:01:57 GMT 2013
        Added more tests to make sure filtering of sites for scaffold works correctly

1.2.1   Fri Nov 22 16:47:30 GMT 2013
        Changed input of scaffold to haps sample format

1.2.0   Thu Nov 21 17:00:46 GMT 2013
        Added nearest neighbor clustering a la IMPUTEv2 only using a scaffold

1.1.24  Wed Oct 16 15:23:05 BST 2013
        Found another bug related to previous bug
        Changed -O1 back to -O3, as the optimization was not a problem after all

1.1.23  Wed Oct 16 15:00:10 BST 2013
        Fixed bug in RelationshipGraph::sampleHap() where for graph type 2 only half 
        the available haplotypes were being sampled from.  
        Changed -O3 to -O1 for default optimization, as the higher -O's seem to be causing 
        bugs in my code at RelationshipGraph::init()

1.1.22  Tue Oct 15 15:34:13 BST 2013
        1) insti now prints '999' instead of 'inf' in GP field of VCF output
        2) insti now checks to make sure probabilities are between 0 and 1 (inclusive)

1.1.21  Wed Oct 09 18:33:53 BST 2013
        caught bug where main does not exit with error of file could not be loaded

1.1.20  Mon Sep 30 17:36:54 BST 2013
        Output VCFs now use GP instead of non-standard AP field

1.1.19  Sun Sep 29 13:34:26 BST 2013
        fixed bug where default number of burnin iterations was 46 instead of 56

1.1.18  Sun Sep 29 12:25:48 BST 2013
        haps are now initialized according to GLs with flat prior

1.1.1   Thu Sep 12 17:16:03 BST 2013
        Added support for clustering of haplotypes

1.0.11  Mon Sep 2 12:23:59 2013
        Version used for GoCD

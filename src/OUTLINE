PROBLEM DEFINITION

I want to re-implement snptools impute and then build on it

HIERARCHY OF TASKS

phase and impute according to snptools
      - parse input data
        - read in GLs from VCF
        - read in reference haplotypes from VCF
      - phase and impute
      - output results
        - output haplotypes and genotype probabilities in VCF
        - output haps and gprobs in impute2 format
